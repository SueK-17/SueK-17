Since 2021, I’ve had the privilege of supporting over 100 stories for USDA NRCS through video documentaries, articles, and photos across two multi-year, multi-state contracts. 
As a naturally curious, lifelong learner, I absolutely love meeting new people, hearing their stories, and learning about different ways of life. 
My role has always been about making my interviewees feel comfortable, so they can share the details that make their stories compelling and real.

Whether I’m working on an article, a proposal, or a video project, I focus on bringing out the best in the people I interview. 
My goal is to make them feel heard, which helps me capture their true essence and create stories that resonate. 
Whether it’s through hundreds of expert interviews for strategic proposals or capturing personal stories for online publications, I thrive on learning and sharing what makes each person and place unique.
